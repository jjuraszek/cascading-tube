cascading-tube
==============
### *patterns for processing* ###

Tiny wrapper around hadoop cascading make it easy to chaining operations. All written in scala but it is not hiding the the cascading framework.
You can always fallback to cascading style of defining flow if you felt you missing something in tube.

**I am looking anybody who wants to help in developing this lib.**

## Motivation ##

Providing clean and not so complicated in use and debug wrapper which can be incorporated in your current hadoop processing project.
Writing MR hadoop jobs in tube is going to be more functional but in the other hand it will never hide you from cascading Pipe class.

## Sample use case ##

## Design insight ##



## Repository, maven and supported versions ##
